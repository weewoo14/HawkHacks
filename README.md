This project was made for HawkHacks 2024.

Ever question how people get addicted to gambling? Ever wonder why casinos exist? And most importantly, ever wonder if it is possible to quit gambling?

Well the Toucan Gacha Simulator aims to answer those questions! 
Taking inspiration from every gacha game that exists (monotone boring auto battling, summoning with 10x pulls, and team creation), the Toucan Gacha Simulator simulates a gacha game, and aims to make the process as boring as possible.
This is done to help possible gacha game addicts realise how badly their addiction is, along with understanding how these addictions may be formed.

This project was made only using PyGame.
